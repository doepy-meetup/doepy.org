# DoEPy: Helping Python Thrive within the National Labs & Department of Energy

## Why DoEPy

We want to create a unique opportunity to see Python succeed and thrive within the National Labs! We propose creating a new resource for scientists, researchers, and technical staff to support their use of Python and to build a strong, lasting community for Python users within the Department of Energy National Labs.
