# DoEPy: Helping Python Thrive within the National Labs & Department of Energy

## Why DoEPy

We want to create a unique opportunity to see Python succeed and thrive within the National Labs! We propose creating a new resource for scientists, researchers, and technical staff to support their use of Python and to build a strong, lasting community for Python users within the Department of Energy National Labs.

### Aric Hagberg

Aric Hagberg is the Deputy Division Leader of the Computer, Computational, and Statistical Sciences Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

He is one of the original creators of the NetworkX Python software package for analyzing complex networks. Before joining Los Alamos as a technical staff member in the Theoretical Division, he earned a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Arizona and was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Nonlinear Studies.

He is active in the academic community and has published articles in mathematics, physics, chemistry, geophysics, engineering, and computer science.

### Exploring network structure, dynamics, and function using NetworkX

NetworkX is a software tool for network science.  I'll tell the previously untold story of how the software project started at Los Alamos and describe the original design goals.   The software scope was driven by research applications such as disease spread, cybersecurity, and measuring scholarly impact.  I'll describe these applications and the algorithms and analyses that were developed to support them.
