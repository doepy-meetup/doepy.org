    Giordon's research focuses on looking for signs of physics Beyond the
    Standard Model with a particular interest in Electroweak Supersymmetry and
    hadronic final states. He is also passionate about boosted object
    reconstruction, jet substructure, pile-up mitigation techniques, designing
    robust hardware triggers, the intersection of particle physics & machine
    learning, and more! Through these efforts, Giordon has also made core
    contributions to improving the communication of physics results between the
    ATLAS Collaboration and particle physics theorists and phenomenologists. He
    also led a group of physicists within the experiment to combine and
    summarize the results of many BSM searches, providing key insights for the
    future of the successful ATLAS Beyond the Standard Model search program.
    These results will be made public later this year. When Giordon is not busy
    trying to prove the existence of new physics, he can be found in the
    kitchen proving sourdoughs, baking pavlovas, and anything else he can get
    his hands on.

  youtube: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXDA6ZFx0bU"
  description: |
    For well over a decade, Python notebooks revolutionized our field. They
    gave us so much creative freedom and dramatically lowered the entry barrier
    for newcomers. Yet despite all this ... it has been a decade! And the
    notebook is still in roughly the same form factor.

    So what if we allow ourselves to rethink notebooks ... really rethink it!
    What features might we come up with? Can we make the notebook understand
    datasources? What about LLMs? Can we generate widgets on the fly? What if
    we make changes to Python itself?

    This presentation will be a stream of demos that help paint a picture of
    what the future might hold. I will share my latest work in the
    [anywidget](https://anywidget.dev/en/getting-started/; _blank)/[marimo](https://marimo.io/; _blank)
    ecosystem as well as some new hardware integrations.

    The main theme that I will work towards: if you want better notebooks,
    reactive Python might very well be the future.

  description: |
    Clear documentation is crucial for the success of open-source libraries,
    but it’s often hard to get right. In this talk, I’ll share our experience
    applying the Diataxis documentation framework to improve two HoloViz
    ecosystem libraries, hvPlot and Panel. Attendees will come away with
    practical insights on applying Diataxis and strengthening documentation for
    their own projects.

    Good documentation turns users into contributors — but achieving it
    requires more than good intentions. This talk shares the journey of applying
    the Diataxis framework to improve two open-source Python libraries from the
    HoloViz ecosystem: Panel and hvPlot.. We’ll start with a short introduction
    to Diataxis (its four documentation types: tutorials, how-to guides,
    explanations, and references), then briefly present the libraries we worked
    on and their documentation challenges.

    The heart of the talk focuses on practical lessons learned: how we mapped
    existing content into the Diataxis structure, handled content gaps and
    redundancies, engaged with the user community, and evolved our approach over
    time. We’ll also discuss what we would do differently if we started again.

    The goal is to give attendees a realistic, hands-on perspective on adopting
    Diataxis — including both its benefits and its challenges.

    > JupyterHub: A multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks

    This is how [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) was described when it was
    announced in 2015, 10 years ago. The focus was on bringing [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
    to multiple users on shared infrastructure. The Jupyter Notebooks
    focus was so strong that Jupyter was even in the name of the project! Fast
    forward 10 years, & this is still the most common perception of JupyterHub.

    However, this has not been true for a *long* time now. Instead of setting
    up 5 different kinds of infrastructure to support your users based on what
    kind of *interface* they like to use (JupyterLab, RStudio, Linux Desktop
    tools like qgis or Napari, Visual Studio Code, full `ssh` (!?), etc) for
    their interactive computing, you can set up a JupyterHub that supports all
    of those! Meet your users where they are, rather than force them to conform
    to using only a specific set of tools.

    Come to this talk to:
    1. See cool demos of various popular applications running on JupyterHub seamlessly
    2. Understand the security model of JupyterHub & how that enables these cool demos
    3. Learn how you can set up your own application to run in JupyterHub
    4. Influence the future of how JupyterHub is marketed

  title: Up-scale Python Functions for High-Performance Computing with executorlib
  youtube: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0gxV-IXVP0"
  description: |
    With the rise of machine-learned interatomic potentials in the atomistic
    simulation community in Materials Science, the complexity of simulation
    workflows changed from directed acyclic graph (DAG) based simulation
    workflows with typically just a single simulation code to simulation
    workflows coupling simulation codes at different length and time scales and
    thousands of individual simulations. To orchestrate these workflows a
    number of simulation frameworks were developed. Still as part of the
    Exascale Computing Project we realized these were limited in their
    flexibility and scalability.

    So, we developed executorlib[1] based on the concurrent futures Executor
    interface in the Python standard library and with the goal to distribute
    Python functions over hundreds of compute nodes. Internally, executorlib
    leverages the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) and the
    flux framework from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory[2] to up-scale
    simulation workflows from a workstation or traditional high-performance
    computers (HPC) to the latest generation of Exascale machines. In contrast
    to previous solutions, it does not require any daemon process or database
    but instead directly interfaces with the job manager to maximize
    computational efficiency.  At the same time, it is designed with a focus on
    debugging capabilities to minimize the overhead of migrating workflows to
    the Exascale machines.

    In this presentation I introduced executorlib, highlighting the lessons
    learned from development of the pyiron atomistic simulation suite which led
    to the development of executorlib as minimalistic workflow manager.
    Finally, I highlight the general applicability of executorlib to distribute
    python functions of any scientific domain on HPC clusters of all sizes.

    The field of solar physics is primarily concerned with understanding the
    physics of the complex outer atmosphere of the Sun, the solar corona.
    Though visible to the naked eye only during a solar eclipse, the corona is
    observed across the electromagnetic spectrum, including the visible,
    extreme ultraviolet and x-ray wavelengths, by both space- and ground-based
    observatories. We are currently entering a so-called "golden age" of solar
    physics in which an increasing number of future solar observatories promise
    to deepen our understanding of this complex plasma environment. However,
    effectively using these data to understand the fundamental physical
    processes in the solar atmosphere requires software capable of searching,
    ingesting, combining, and analyzing data from these many different data
    sources, all of which are growing both in size and complexity. The SunPy
    Project aims to solve this challenge by building and maintaining an
    ecosystem of interoperable, community-developed, open-source Python
    packages for analyzing solar physics data.In this talk, I'll provide a
    brief history of the SunPy Project, the current state of the Project as
    well as the software landscape in solar physics more broadly, and discuss
    how the Project is moving forward. Throughout my talk, I will illustrate
    these points using my own journey into the world of open-source scientific
    Python software development and how that has informed my career as a solar
    physicist.

    In this exchange, I will present VocalPy, the core package of a software
    community for researchers that study how animals communicate with sound.
    For this audience, I will focus on the domain-driven design approach I am
    taking to develop the package. This approach has resulted in features that
    are (arguably) not common in scientific Python packages.
    For example, domain-specific data types, and pipelines consisting of classes
    that use callbacks. I will contrast these features with the design of many
    core scientific Python packages, that typically place an emphasis on a purely
    functional approach operating mainly on numpy arrays. I will discuss the
    trade-offs involved; for example, the potential for increased readability and
    reproducibility, but along with that a potential increase in maintenance
    burden. You will walk away with a better understanding of bioacoustics and
    animal communication, and some food for thought about how we design
    scientific software.

    Searches for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider have constrained many models of physics beyond the Standard Model.
    Many searches also provide resources that allow them to be reinterpreted in the context of other models. We describe a
    reinterpretation pipeline that examines previously untested models of new physics using supplementary information from
    ATLAS SUSY searches, such as public analysis routines and serialized likelihoods, in a way that provides accurate limits
    even in models that differ meaningfully from the benchmark models of the original analysis. These resources are combined
    with common event generation and simulation toolkits MadGraph, Pythia, and Delphes into workflows steered by TOML
    configuration files, and bundled into the mapyde python package.

    working with data from a number of its precipitation and cloud radars, but
    has been designed so that it can be used by others in the radar and
    atmospheric communities to examine, processes, and analyze data from many
    types of weather radars.

    We discuss the growth of this toolkit, where it fits into the general open radar science community, and future directions of the package!

    With the first Exascale computers becoming available and with machine
    learning becoming a fundamental building block of many research projects,
    we have to rethink the way we manage our simulations and analysis. Moving
    away from shell scripts and a zoo of different utilities and simulation
    codes, pyiron[1,2], in analogy to an integrated development environment
    (IDE), provides a central interface for rapid prototyping and up-scaling
    simulation protocols. The whole simulation lifecycle is represented in
    pyiron by a class of generic objects – the pyiron objects – which connect
    to the job management, the data storage interface and the user interface.
    As a result, the individual objects can be combined like building blocks
    to construct complex simulation protocols and enable the automation of
    routine tasks.

    Jan Janssen is a Postdoctoral research associate at the Los Alamos National
    Laboratory interested in atomistic simulations for materials science.

    As part of his PhD, he developed the open-source workflow framework pyiron,
    which couples atomistic simulation codes written in Fortran, C or C++ to a
    modern jupyter-based user interface, data storage and job management. With
    this combination pyiron enables rapid prototyping and up-scaling of
    simulation protocols for exascale computing and is applied for parameter
    studies in materials science ranging from uncertainty quantification for
    density functional theory to the prediction of melting temperatures for
    interatomic potentials and beyond.

    Besides leading the development of pyiron, Jan maintains over 430 materials
    science related software packages for the conda-forge community channel and
    is a regular contributor to python-based materials science software.

    The more widespread Scientific Python becomes, the more the distributed
