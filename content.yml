    > JupyterHub: A multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks

    This is how [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) was described when it was
    announced in 2015, 10 years ago. The focus was on bringing [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
    to multiple users on shared infrastructure. The Jupyter Notebooks
    focus was so strong that Jupyter was even in the name of the project! Fast
    forward 10 years, & this is still the most common perception of JupyterHub.

    However, this has not been true for a *long* time now. Instead of setting
    up 5 different kinds of infrastructure to support your users based on what
    kind of *interface* they like to use (JupyterLab, RStudio, Linux Desktop
    tools like qgis or Napari, Visual Studio Code, full `ssh` (!?), etc) for
    their interactive computing, you can set up a JupyterHub that supports all
    of those! Meet your users where they are, rather than force them to conform
    to using only a specific set of tools.

    Come to this talk to:
    1. See cool demos of various popular applications running on JupyterHub seamlessly
    2. Understand the security model of JupyterHub & how that enables these cool demos
    3. Learn how you can set up your own application to run in JupyterHub
    4. Influence the future of how JupyterHub is marketed

  title: Up-scale Python Functions for High-Performance Computing with executorlib
  youtube: ""
  description: |
    With the rise of machine-learned interatomic potentials in the atomistic
    simulation community in Materials Science, the complexity of simulation
    workflows changed from directed acyclic graph (DAG) based simulation
    workflows with typically just a single simulation code to simulation
    workflows coupling simulation codes at different length and time scales and
    thousands of individual simulations. To orchestrate these workflows a
    number of simulation frameworks were developed. Still as part of the
    Exascale Computing Project we realized these were limited in their
    flexibility and scalability.

    So, we developed executorlib[1] based on the concurrent futures Executor
    interface in the Python standard library and with the goal to distribute
    Python functions over hundreds of compute nodes. Internally, executorlib
    leverages the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) and the
    flux framework from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory[2] to up-scale
    simulation workflows from a workstation or traditional high-performance
    computers (HPC) to the latest generation of Exascale machines. In contrast
    to previous solutions, it does not require any daemon process or database
    but instead directly interfaces with the job manager to maximize
    computational efficiency.  At the same time, it is designed with a focus on
    debugging capabilities to minimize the overhead of migrating workflows to
    the Exascale machines.

    In this presentation I introduced executorlib, highlighting the lessons
    learned from development of the pyiron atomistic simulation suite which led
    to the development of executorlib as minimalistic workflow manager.
    Finally, I highlight the general applicability of executorlib to distribute
    python functions of any scientific domain on HPC clusters of all sizes.

    iminuit, and generally, how you get the best performance for a particular
    fit. Fitting speed in research matters: if an analysis runs quickly, one can
    do more checks and variations, and it makes computationally-intensive methods
    like the bootstrap for error estimation feasible."

    Searches for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider have constrained many models of physics beyond the Standard Model.
    Many searches also provide resources that allow them to be reinterpreted in the context of other models. We describe a
    reinterpretation pipeline that examines previously untested models of new physics using supplementary information from
    ATLAS SUSY searches, such as public analysis routines and serialized likelihoods, in a way that provides accurate limits
    even in models that differ meaningfully from the benchmark models of the original analysis. These resources are combined
    with common event generation and simulation toolkits MadGraph, Pythia, and Delphes into workflows steered by TOML
    configuration files, and bundled into the mapyde python package.

    The more widespread Scientific Python becomes, the more the distributed
    nature and multiple projects will make it hard for newcomers to understand
    the landscape. In particular, documentation for "All in one" proprietary
    and closed source solutions is easier to find. Now that the world is
    hyper-connected, computing is ubiquitous and CI virtually free, I believe
    we can have a much better documentation experience.
  bio: |
    Matthias Bussonnier is a Software Engineer, and long-time open source
    contributor to many projects from the scientific stack. He has been a
    maintainer of IPython for over 10 years, and co-founder of Jupyter, for
    which he shares the ACM System Software award in 2017.

    His training as a physicist and experiences at multiple research institutes
    (SLAC, Institut Curie, UC Berkeley, LBNL, UC Merced) put him in a perfect
    position to understand the computation and programming needs of researchers
    and scientists in many fields.

    He currently applies this knowledge at QuanSight Labs, where he helps push
    several projects forward. His current focus is on Napari (Multi-dimensional
    image viewer for Python), and Papyri: a project to push the capabilities of
    Python Documentation forward.

    During the nights and weekends, Matthias Bussonnier also works tirelessly to
    interface with the users and contributors in open source communities around
    issues of mentorship, sustainability, security, diversity and inclusion. He
    is currently also helping to bring more Scientific Python to Social and Human
    Sciences in France (and in French) via classes and book co-authoring.

    Laurie Stephey is a Scientific Data Architect in the Data and Analytics
    Services group at NERSC. She started at NERSC as a postdoc working on Python
    optimization targeted at Cori’s Intel’s KNL architecture for the Dark Energy
    Spectroscopic Experiment processing pipeline. She now works on larger Python
    strategy and stewardship at NERSC with a focus on helping Python and
    data-intensive users be productive on NERSC systems. She works closely with
    two of NERSC’s “Superfacility” experimental teams: DESI and a team targeting
    real-time analysis for KSTAR, a Korean tokamak. She also works on efforts to
    maintain and expand NERSC’s user-facing container infrastructure. Finally,
    she is on the team helping to plan and procure NERSC’s next system N10.

    Daniel Margala recently joined the Data & Analytics Services group at NERSC
    to help scientific Python users at NERSC effectively use GPUs on the new
    Perlmutter system. Previously, as a postdoc in the NERSC Exascale Science
    Application Program (NESAP), he worked with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
    Instrument (DESI) to leverage GPUs in their data processing pipeline which
    is implemented primarily in Python.
